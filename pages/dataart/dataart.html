                <H2>The Death of stealth games</H2>

                <p>I've collected some data, thanks to the rawg.io API. Over here, I specifically only have data on some recent gaming favourites, as well as upcoming releases. Feel free to browse.</p>
                <p>My website, is mainly a casestudy on my favourite genre, STEALTH GAMES, disguised as a gaming database. They've become more and more rare. But before we get to that, let's look at the most recent AAA game releases wont we. </p>

            Now, some of the releases, are actually DLC or remasters/remakes of older games, so their release dates will be before the minimum release of 2024. This is of no relevance however.

                <P>These are some high quality games. But the most interesting point here, with the context of my research is the lack there of, of stealth games within the biggest games of the year. Not even 1</P>
                <P>While I agree with the fact that the genre, has always been relatively niche, it's been increasingly fading however.  </P>

                In total, this number is an absurdly low one, when we compare it to other sub-genre's, like shooters, open-worlds and RPGs, which have seen a very
                noticable uptic in their development. There are some underlying factors to this however, one of them being stealh games, requiring very complex and
                inovative systems for almost every single new iteration within the genre. Metal Gear Solid V for example, is one of the most well rounded action-adventure 
                game of any in terms of it's mechanic complexity and intuitivness. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This opens up an even Bigger issue however, one that isn't just limited to a single genre, but is affecting the entirety of the games industry. One that is caused by exploding 
                budgets, and the avoidance in any of failure that comes with it. Devs/Publishers are less in line with making expensive big blockbuster games, with the advent failure of Concord, 
                Skull n Bones and so on serving as warnings.
