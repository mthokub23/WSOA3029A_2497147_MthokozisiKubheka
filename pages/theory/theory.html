                    <h2>Analysis of Bloombergs Billionaire Index RE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Data is the new gold mine, but like any raw material, its value is only unlocked once processed through effective processing and presentation. Presenting the data visually meaningfully becomes essential in creating palatable and consumable products in data-driven journalism. This essay will examine Bloomberg's interactive article on the world's favorite people, billionaires, which employs rankings and personal profiles to convert financial data and personal profiles. The essay will explore how these techniques enhance the communication of data insights by analyzing the interplay of visual design, interactivity, and narrative elements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project is presented less as an article and more as a data project. When opening the site, you are greeted initially by the huge title, "Bloomberg Billionaires Index," BBI for short, as well as the description. It presents a "daily ranking of the world's richest people," their calculated net worths, and any other changes. The names on the first page are presented in a standard list. It has an array of filters available to the user, in particular ranking, name ( alphabetical), net worth ( asc-desc), change in worth, industry of work, and country. As mentioned, it is standard stuff (figure 1) and presented well. This page is still only text but already uses visual cues and signifiers. For example, green represents positive change in increases, while red represents negative changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are more interactive elements once you have clicked on an individua(Figure 2). Clicking on them takes you to a separate page that goes into more detail about the individual. Here, we can access more information about the individual, a random fact about them, and detailed financials. The financial data is presented in a graph, with filters on year. The range scales from the current to the earliest operation date of the individual's recorded net assets. Right below this graph, another visual is used to differentiate and filter the individuals' assets into categories summarized as cash, private assets, public assets, and other liabilities. Lastly, there is a confidence rating and a lengthy biography(Figure 3).
                    </p>

                       <h3> Visualization Techniques and Effectiveness</h3>

                        Lightly touched upon this, but the project uses a variety of visuals to present the data. As discussed by Cole Knaflic in "Storytelling with Data," every visual should have a clear purpose, such as showing trends, patterns, comparisons, and relationships. The main visual used is the table/list, used to rank the individuals. Its primary is, of course, to organize large amounts of data into easier-to-digest formats. The filters also allow the user agency to customize their view, enabling further comparisons and trend analysis across various variables. This aligns with the idea that "effective data visualization aims to simplify and clarify data, allowing the audience to focus on the most important insights" (Knaflic,2015).
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        The table structure is particularly effective because it is provided in a format most people can easily navigate. Sorting and filtering add a layer of interactivity that encourages more profound engagement with the data(Figure 4). The reduction of cognitive load principle is also met here, empowering the user to explore in a way that is meaningful to them. Another visual used is the line graph for financials. This tracks the individual's net worth over time and is an excellent application of Knaflic's principle. Because they are mostly commonly used to represent continuous data, this fits well with using it over something better suited for categorical data(Knaflic, 2015, p.45). Another visual that can be used is the asset breakdown visual. This relates more to a 100% stacked horizontal bar, as described by Knaflic. However, it is not in a chart with any of the visuals. The usage of the visual is still welcome, emphasizing the correct and appropriate visual fitting well here. It simplifies financial portfolios into more digestible categories, using color to make the data precise.
                    </p>

                       <h3> Design Principles and User Interactivity</h3>
                        The point of interactivity is creating a bridge between the raw data and user understanding. The goal is to allow users to engage with the content more meaningfully, as we have already mentioned. The multiple visualization techniques already mentioned to be at play on the site help users customize their view of the data. Thereby increasing overall engagement and comprehension. This aligns with Mailloux's (1983) idea of conventions being ever-evolving and dynamic context-based interactions. From a personal standpoint, all the information on the website is well done and very effective in improving user engagement. The elements are being used well to employ the users' engagement. The most important reason, however, is how much you can see patterns and trends the more you use the elements. In particular, by filtering through industries and countries, we see technology-based industries and first-world countries having the most entrances into the list. Another trend of one or two individuals from a lesser developed country being on the list is an exciting development that could go deeper into economic and equality dynamics in these regions.                       
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     <h3> UI/UX Design Principles</h3>  

                        Interface and user experience also go hand in hand in improving user engagement in my books. The site is, by design, made with high user engagement in mind, which is also an essential aspect of its overall effectiveness. Everything on here lets the user pick the data they want to interact with instead of using principles synonymous with dark development, allowing the user to create their own story while using the data, but I will touch on that later. In Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology(2004), Steve Gibson looks at the importance of non-invasive interfaces prioritizing the user's natural interaction with technology. He uses an example of the Martin Lighting Director as a form of technology that adapts to the user to create an adaptive user experience(Gibson,2004, pg.6). In the context of the BBI, the interface's non-invasive nature lies more in its simplicity and ease of use. The design is manageable for the user at any time. I would even suggest that, at times, it becomes too simple not to give any further details, specifically when looking at financial increases in the total net worth of the individuals. Another principle in place is Mailloux's (1983) principle of conventions being based on the context of history and the user's specific needs at the given time.
                        Many will already have been accustomed to using filters and sortable lists. It would have been misplaced for a 3D pie chart to appear on the list. In general, it added an unneeded layer of complexity. More minor decisions, like using green to indicate growth and red to indicate a decline in revenue. All the UI/UX principles are suitable for keeping the site simple and easy to use. Despite all this, however, pushing beyond the already established conventions to be more memorable and pleasing. One example could be adaptive interfaces that respond to the user's behavior and actions over time, creating a more personalized experience. The site could start filtering and showing you the content of individuals from the same industries and countries you've been looking at. This would align even more with Gibson's principle of advocating for more adaptive and sensory-focused interactions to foster more user engagement over functional systems and conventions based on context.
                        

                    </p>


                    <p>
                       <h3> Data/Driven Storytelling</h3>

                        I spoke a bit earlier about the website's visualization data techniques, which want the user to create their own story or narrative. The lack of a narrative is present right from the start. There needs to be a clear starting point here. The importance of a narrative that ties together information to provide a clear goal for the audience needs to be added (Knaflic, 2015, p.174-175). There also is not a direct structure, with the closest element of this being the description, which allows the users to view the biggest movers, change markets, and track returns. Something that could have been done is giving reasons for movement and trends based on their markets. The only usage of historical grounding is when an individual's background is being explained, not the present-day reasons for any changes. More considerable emphasis is placed on giving the user the agency to do with the dataset what they want and create their own story. The more you click on different options, the more context the data develops and creates independently instead of being directly guided. I have already spoken about how the website is highly effective at this. Gibson and Papanek's principles of balance between user agency and structured storytelling could have been met by providing more adaptive features that enhance the overall experience of the storytelling aspect.
                        Together, these elements used on the website create a very neutral experience. The backgrounds are grey, and the colors of font primarily used are white, with the occasional red, green, and yellow. Nothing on the website goes for an "exciting" or "gloomy" feel. They do not contribute much to the experience and foster a neutral experience, with the user again being the sole candidate for creating their narrative through the site's navigation. 
                        

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the end, Bloomberg's Billionaire Index leverages its visualization techniques, interactivity, and design principles to create a neutral yet engaging platform. It's only major failings are in the lack of balancing user agency and a structured narrative.

                        <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Mailloux discusses how conventions are not static but dynamic and ever-evolving through context-specific interactions. He states that they’re shared practices that provide rules for the production and interpretation of texts within particular contexts (Mailloux, 1983, p.9). In our context, this relates to design conventions, such as UI patterns and models that guide both the designer’s creations and the user’s experience of digital platforms. He further discusses the role of context in shaping and redefining these conventions, noting that “the context of a convention includes its history, the social and political conditions of its usage, and the specific situation in which it's applied" (Mailloux, 1983, p.11).
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                Papanek discusses what is design.
                                <br>
                                Gibson looks at the exploration of alternative interfaces in tech, particularly the shift from traditional setups to more sensory-focused interactions. He argues that certain approaches are invasive. One system he examines is Stelarc’s “Third Hand” system. Approaches that take advantage of human and machine connections to adapt to technological advancements remain niche due to their complexity. In contrast, the Martin Lighting Director utilizes sonar technology to track body movement within a space, creating a non-invasive interface, allowing the user to control multimedia elements through simple gestures. This system also has the added benefit of being adaptable across various applications from VR to gaming (Gibson, 2004).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
            
                        <p>
                            With this in mind, the idea being spread by all three is that of user-friendly design, particularly non-traditional systems that take advantage of new conventions without being invasive or making it harder for the user. We want to note the ever-changing conventions as mentioned by Mailloux and design around similar patterns. For example, we don't want to trick users into following dark UI patterns.

                        <h5>Data Visualization on the Web</h5>
            
                        <p><strong>Big Data:</strong> Data that is a bit too large to properly understand. Creating a way to visualize and view it makes it far easier to comprehend.</p>
            
                        <p>Data representation and visualization make understanding data with context far easier. This is especially true when we see the different elements that influence the data.</p>
            
                        <h5>How Does This Relate to Web Development?</h5>
            
                        <p>We need to think about what we want the web to achieve. Clients and consumers want the web to be capable of doing everything. They expect all devices to offer a full feature set. That feature set can be taken advantage of using our HTML, JavaScript, and CSS toolkits.</p>
            
                        <p>How we represent data largely influences the user experience. We can sometimes "trick" users by communicating things that might not directly correlate, in order to create a narrative or fuel an agenda. We must be responsible in how we use data.</p>
            
                        <p>As with stories, most data visualization is narrative-driven. This is done with the intention of creating a certain "truth". The toolkit is important in helping us be more truthful.</p>

                            <h4>APIs</h4>
                            <p>APIs are sets of rules and protocols basically designed to allow different software components to communicate with each other. They define how requests and responses should be structured, enabling interaction between the applications or between different parts of the same application. Basically, smaller cogs in a system designed to communicate with the other parts to finish certain tasks.</p>
                            
                            Types of APIs
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Web APIs:</strong> Accessible over the web and are used to retrieve or send data to servers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Library APIs:</strong> Allow developers to use pre-built functions to perform specific tasks.</li>
                                <li><strong>OS APIs:</strong> They allow software to interact with the underlying OS.</li>
                            </ul>
                
                            <h3>APIs in Visualization</h3>
                            <p><strong>Restful APIs:</strong> Allow APIs to communicate with back-end servers using HTTP requests.</p>
                            <p><strong>GraphQL APIs:</strong> Unlike REST, these allow you to query the exact points you need, unlike REST which needs multiple endpoints for different data needs. Useful for complex visualizations where different parts of the data model need to be queried dynamically.</p>
                
                            <h3>Library APIs for Data Manipulation and Visualization</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>D3.js API:</strong> D3.js provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to bind data to the DOM and create complex visualizations using data-driven transformations. It includes methods for selecting elements (e.g., <code>d3.select()</code>), binding data, and applying scales, axes, and transitions to the visual elements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Canvas and SVG APIs:</strong> Interact with the Canvas API or SVG API, depending on whether you’re using HTML5 Canvas or SVG to render visualizations.</li>
                            </ul>
                
                            <h3>Principles to Keep in Mind</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Keep everything consistent in naming conventions for methods and structuring data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> They abstract more complex operations into smaller, easier-to-use, manageable functions. D3.js does a lot of the complex aspects of DOM manipulation and data binding, allowing developers to focus on their design goals rather than the implementation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Good APIs are flexible, giving developers the power to use them in a variety of contexts.</li>
                            </ul>
                
                            <p><strong>Common APIs used with D3.js:</strong> Map APIs, Data APIs, and Visualization APIs. Keep security in mind as well—authentication is crucial because it ensures only authorized users can access the API. Always ensure the data itself is sanitized and validated to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.</p>
                        
                
                            <h4>Knaflic (2015) - Choosing an Effective Visual (Chapter 2)</h4>
                            <p>The chapter emphasizes the importance of choosing the correct visual to effectively communicate data, based on the context, of course. Knaflic stresses the importance of simplicity. Sometimes, it's better to use simple text because it’s more powerful than a graph when trying to be straightforward about the information we want to convey (Knaflic, 2015, p.19).</p>
                
                            <p><strong>Tables:</strong> are more important when the goal is to represent detailed information that the audience may need to reference or compare directly. They are well-suited for situations where precision is crucial because of their accuracy and the ability to see specific numbers and compare them across multiple dimensions. For example, financial reports or performance metrics, where accuracy down to the smallest decimal is important, can have huge implications if not done well. Knaflic also points out that tables "align more with our verbal system."</p>
                
                            <p><strong>Graphs:</strong> on the other hand, engage our visual system. They are great for creating perspective for the user (Knaflic, 2015, p.22). Graphs can also be absorbed quickly by looking at patterns. Tables should be kept minimalist and simple in design. The emphasis should be on the information itself rather than the grid lines and other decorative elements.</p>
                
                            <p><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> are a hybrid approach that combine the details of tables with visual cues from graphs, allowing for quicker identification of key data points. An example of their effectiveness is in football and sports analytics, where heatmaps are used to represent movement, performance, and areas of activity.</p>

                            <h3>Rationale For Chosen Readings?</h3>

                            <p>
                              The selected topics and approaches align with my primary goal: creating a gaming database website, that also works
                              as the home of a case studies related to the topics. I initially chose to analyze the Bloomberg Billionaire Index
                              because the site and project overall fit my idea of a very functional insightful data driven website. The interactivity
                              on display on the website, was easy to navigate, and well designed visuals, with my only real issue with them, being the lack
                              of a deep narrative or story being told using the data. However, I liked how regardless of that, the data was well used. 


                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Mailloux’s idea that conventions evolve based on their historical and social contexts reflects the way gaming genres—like
                                 stealth—have adapted or declined over time. In the same way, the UI patterns and storytelling methods discussed in my readings
                                  informed the way I planned to represent the data visually. I also drew from Knaflic's principles of data visualization, which 
                                  emphasize simplicity and clarity in visual storytelling. These principles were essential in ensuring that the data I present—whether 
                                  about game releases or the decline of stealth games—remains accessible and engaging for the audience, allowing them to draw their own insights.
