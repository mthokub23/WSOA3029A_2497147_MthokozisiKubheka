                    <h2>Analysis of Bloombergs Billionaire Index RE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Data is the new gold mine, but like any raw material, its value is only unlocked once processed through effective processing and presentation. Presenting the data visually meaningfully becomes essential in creating palatable and consumable products in data-driven journalism. This essay will examine Bloomberg's interactive article on the world's favorite people, billionaires, which employs rankings and personal profiles to convert financial data and personal profiles. The essay will explore how these techniques enhance the communication of data insights by analyzing the interplay of visual design, interactivity, and narrative elements.

                    <p>
                        The project is presented less as an article and more as a data project. When opening the site, you are greeted initially by the huge title, "Bloomberg Billionaires Index," BBI for short, as well as the description. It presents a "daily ranking of the world's richest people," their calculated net worths, and any other changes. The names on the first page are presented in a standard list. It has an array of filters available to the user, in particular ranking, name ( alphabetical), net worth ( asc-desc), change in worth, industry of work, and country. As mentioned, it is standard stuff (figure 1) and presented well. This page is still only text but already uses visual cues and signifiers. For example, green represents positive change in increases, while red represents negative changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are more interactive elements once you have clicked on an individua(Figure 2). Clicking on them takes you to a separate page that goes into more detail about the individual. Here, we can access more information about the individual, a random fact about them, and detailed financials. The financial data is presented in a graph, with filters on year. The range scales from the current to the earliest operation date of the individual's recorded net assets. Right below this graph, another visual is used to differentiate and filter the individuals' assets into categories summarized as cash, private assets, public assets, and other liabilities. Lastly, there is a confidence rating and a lengthy biography(Figure 3).

                       <h3> Visualization Techniques and Effectiveness</h3>

                       <p>Lightly touched upon this, but the project uses a variety of visuals to present the data. As discussed by Cole Knaflic in "Storytelling with Data," every visual should have a clear purpose, such as showing trends, patterns, comparisons, and relationships. The main visual used is the table/list, used to rank the individuals. Its primary is, of course, to organize large amounts of data into easier-to-digest formats. The filters also allow the user agency to customize their view, enabling further comparisons and trend analysis across various variables. This aligns with the idea that "effective data visualization aims to simplify and clarify data, allowing the audience to focus on the most important insights" (Knaflic,2015).
                    </p> 
                    
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        The table structure is particularly effective because it is provided in a format most people can easily navigate. Sorting and filtering add a layer of interactivity that encourages more profound engagement with the data(Figure 4). The reduction of cognitive load principle is also met here, empowering the user to explore in a way that is meaningful to them. Another visual used is the line graph for financials. This tracks the individual's net worth over time and is an excellent application of Knaflic's principle. Because they are mostly commonly used to represent continuous data, this fits well with using it over something better suited for categorical data(Knaflic, 2015, p.45). Another visual that can be used is the asset breakdown visual. This relates more to a 100% stacked horizontal bar, as described by Knaflic. However, it is not in a chart with any of the visuals. The usage of the visual is still welcome, emphasizing the correct and appropriate visual fitting well here. It simplifies financial portfolios into more digestible categories, using color to make the data precise.

                       <h3> Design Principles and User Interactivity</h3>
                    <p>   
                        The point of interactivity is creating a bridge between the raw data and user understanding. The goal is to allow users to engage with the content more meaningfully, as we have already mentioned. The multiple visualization techniques already mentioned to be at play on the site help users customize their view of the data. Thereby increasing overall engagement and comprehension. This aligns with Mailloux's (1983) idea of conventions being ever-evolving and dynamic context-based interactions. From a personal standpoint, all the information on the website is well done and very effective in improving user engagement. The elements are being used well to employ the users' engagement. The most important reason, however, is how much you can see patterns and trends the more you use the elements. In particular, by filtering through industries and countries, we see technology-based industries and first-world countries having the most entrances into the list. Another trend of one or two individuals from a lesser developed country being on the list is an exciting development that could go deeper into economic and equality dynamics in these regions.                       
                    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     <h3> UI/UX Design Principles</h3>  
                     
                     <p>
                        Interface and user experience also go hand in hand in improving user engagement in my books. The site is, by design, made with high user engagement in mind, which is also an essential aspect of its overall effectiveness. Everything on here lets the user pick the data they want to interact with instead of using principles synonymous with dark development, allowing the user to create their own story while using the data, but I will touch on that later. In Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology(2004), Steve Gibson looks at the importance of non-invasive interfaces prioritizing the user's natural interaction with technology. He uses an example of the Martin Lighting Director as a form of technology that adapts to the user to create an adaptive user experience(Gibson,2004, pg.6). In the context of the BBI, the interface's non-invasive nature lies more in its simplicity and ease of use. The design is manageable for the user at any time. I would even suggest that, at times, it becomes too simple not to give any further details, specifically when looking at financial increases in the total net worth of the individuals. Another principle in place is Mailloux's (1983) principle of conventions being based on the context of history and the user's specific needs at the given time.
                        Many will already have been accustomed to using filters and sortable lists. It would have been misplaced for a 3D pie chart to appear on the list. In general, it added an unneeded layer of complexity. More minor decisions, like using green to indicate growth and red to indicate a decline in revenue. All the UI/UX principles are suitable for keeping the site simple and easy to use. Despite all this, however, pushing beyond the already established conventions to be more memorable and pleasing. One example could be adaptive interfaces that respond to the user's behavior and actions over time, creating a more personalized experience. The site could start filtering and showing you the content of individuals from the same industries and countries you've been looking at. This would align even more with Gibson's principle of advocating for more adaptive and sensory-focused interactions to foster more user engagement over functional systems and conventions based on context.

                       <h3> Data/Driven Storytelling</h3>

                       <p>
                        I spoke a bit earlier about the website's visualization data techniques, which want the user to create their own story or narrative. The lack of a narrative is present right from the start. There needs to be a clear starting point here. The importance of a narrative that ties together information to provide a clear goal for the audience needs to be added (Knaflic, 2015, p.174-175). There also is not a direct structure, with the closest element of this being the description, which allows the users to view the biggest movers, change markets, and track returns. Something that could have been done is giving reasons for movement and trends based on their markets. The only usage of historical grounding is when an individual's background is being explained, not the present-day reasons for any changes. More considerable emphasis is placed on giving the user the agency to do with the dataset what they want and create their own story. The more you click on different options, the more context the data develops and creates independently instead of being directly guided. I have already spoken about how the website is highly effective at this. Gibson and Papanek's principles of balance between user agency and structured storytelling could have been met by providing more adaptive features that enhance the overall experience of the storytelling aspect.
                        Together, these elements used on the website create a very neutral experience. The backgrounds are grey, and the colors of font primarily used are white, with the occasional red, green, and yellow. Nothing on the website goes for an "exciting" or "gloomy" feel. They do not contribute much to the experience and foster a neutral experience, with the user again being the sole candidate for creating their narrative through the site's navigation. 
                       </p> 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the end, Bloomberg's Billionaire Index leverages its visualization techniques, interactivity, and design principles to create a neutral yet engaging platform. It's only major failings are in the lack of balancing user agency and a structured narrative.

                        <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>   Mailloux discusses how conventions are not static but dynamic and ever-evolving through context-specific interactions. He states that they’re shared practices that provide rules for the production and interpretation of texts within particular contexts (Mailloux, 1983, p.9). In our context, this relates to design conventions, such as UI patterns and models that guide both the designer’s creations and the user’s experience of digital platforms. He further discusses the role of context in shaping and redefining these conventions, noting that “the context of a convention includes its history, the social and political conditions of its usage, and the specific situation in which it's applied" (Mailloux, 1983, p.11).
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <p>  
                                Papanek discusses what is design.
                                <br>
                                Gibson looks at the exploration of alternative interfaces in tech, particularly the shift from traditional setups to more sensory-focused interactions. He argues that certain approaches are invasive. One system he examines is Stelarc’s “Third Hand” system. Approaches that take advantage of human and machine connections to adapt to technological advancements remain niche due to their complexity. In contrast, the Martin Lighting Director utilizes sonar technology to track body movement within a space, creating a non-invasive interface, allowing the user to control multimedia elements through simple gestures. This system also has the added benefit of being adaptable across various applications from VR to gaming (Gibson, 2004).
                            </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
            
                        <p>
                            With this in mind, the idea being spread by all three is that of user-friendly design, particularly non-traditional systems that take advantage of new conventions without being invasive or making it harder for the user. We want to note the ever-changing conventions as mentioned by Mailloux and design around similar patterns. For example, we don't want to trick users into following dark UI patterns.

                        <h5>Data Visualization on the Web</h5>
            
                        <p><strong>Big Data:</strong> Data that is a bit too large to properly understand. Creating a way to visualize and view it makes it far easier to comprehend.</p>
            
                        <p>Data representation and visualization make understanding data with context far easier. This is especially true when we see the different elements that influence the data.</p>
            
                        <h5>How Does This Relate to Web Development?</h5>
            
                        <p>We need to think about what we want the web to achieve. Clients and consumers want the web to be capable of doing everything. They expect all devices to offer a full feature set. That feature set can be taken advantage of using our HTML, JavaScript, and CSS toolkits.</p>
            
                        <p>How we represent data largely influences the user experience. We can sometimes "trick" users by communicating things that might not directly correlate, in order to create a narrative or fuel an agenda. We must be responsible in how we use data.</p>
            
                        <p>As with stories, most data visualization is narrative-driven. This is done with the intention of creating a certain "truth". The toolkit is important in helping us be more truthful.</p>

                                <h4>APIs</h4>
                                <p>APIs are sets of rules and protocols designed to allow different software components to communicate with each other. They define how requests and responses should be structured, enabling interaction between applications or between different parts of the same application. Basically, smaller cogs in a system designed to communicate with the other parts to finish certain tasks.</p>
                                
                                <h5>Types of APIs</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p><b>Web APIs:</b> Accessible over the web and are used to retrieve or send data to servers.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><b>Library APIs:</b> Allow developers to use pre-built functions to perform specific tasks.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><b>OS APIs:</b> They allow software to interact with the underlying OS.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>APIs in Visualization</h4>
                                <p><b>Restful APIs:</b> Allow APIs to communicate with back-end servers using HTTP requests.</p>
                                <p><b>GraphQL APIs:</b> Unlike REST, these allow you to query the exact points you need, unlike REST which needs multiple endpoints for different data needs. Useful for complex visualizations where different parts of the data model need to be queried dynamically.</p>

                                <h4>Library APIs for Data Manipulation and Visualization</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p><b>D3.js API:</b> D3.js provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to bind data to the DOM and create complex visualizations using data-driven transformations. It includes methods for selecting elements (e.g., <code>d3.select()</code>), binding data, and applying scales, axes, and transitions to the visual elements.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><b>Canvas and SVG APIs:</b> Interact with the Canvas API or SVG API, depending on whether you’re using HTML5 Canvas or SVG to render visualizations.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Principles to Keep in Mind</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p><b>Consistency:</b> Keep everything consistent in naming conventions for methods and structuring data.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><b>Abstraction:</b> They abstract more complex operations into smaller, easier-to-use, manageable functions. D3.js does a lot of the complex aspects of DOM manipulation and data binding, allowing developers to focus on their design goals rather than the implementation.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><b>Flexibility:</b> Good APIs are flexible, giving developers the power to use them in a variety of contexts.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><b>Common APIs used with D3.js:</b> Map APIs, Data APIs, and Visualization APIs. Keep security in mind as well—authentication is crucial because it ensures only authorized users can access the API. Always ensure the data itself is sanitized and validated to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.</p>

                                <h4>Knaflic (2015) - Choosing an Effective Visual (Chapter 2)</h4>
                                <p>The chapter emphasizes the importance of choosing the correct visual to effectively communicate data, based on the context, of course. Knaflic stresses the importance of simplicity. Sometimes, it's better to use simple text because it’s more powerful than a graph when trying to be straightforward about the information we want to convey (Knaflic, 2015, p.19).</p>

                                <p><b>Tables:</b> are more important when the goal is to represent detailed information that the audience may need to reference or compare directly. They are well-suited for situations where precision is crucial because of their accuracy and the ability to see specific numbers and compare them across multiple dimensions. For example, financial reports or performance metrics, where accuracy down to the smallest decimal is important, can have huge implications if not done well. Knaflic also points out that tables "align more with our verbal system."</p>

                                <p><b>Graphs:</b> on the other hand, engage our visual system. They are great for creating perspective for the user (Knaflic, 2015, p.22). Graphs can also be absorbed quickly by looking at patterns. Tables should be kept minimalist and simple in design. The emphasis should be on the information itself rather than the grid lines and other decorative elements.</p>

                                <p><b>Heatmaps:</b> are a hybrid approach that combine the details of tables with visual cues from graphs, allowing for quicker identification of key data points. An example of their effectiveness is in football and sports analytics, where heatmaps are used to represent movement, performance, and areas of activity.</p>

                              The selected topics and approaches align with my primary goal: creating a gaming database website, that also works
                              as the home of a case studies related to the topics. I initially chose to analyze the Bloomberg Billionaire Index
                              because the site and project overall fit my idea of a very functional insightful data driven website. The interactivity

                              of a deep narrative or story being told using the data. However, I liked how regardless of that, the data was well used.

                                Mailloux’s idea that conventions evolve based on their historical and social contexts reflects the way gaming genres—like
                                 stealth—have adapted or declined over time. In the same way, the UI patterns and storytelling methods discussed in my readings
                                  informed the way I planned to represent the data visually. I also drew from Knaflic's principles of data visualization, which 
                                  emphasize simplicity and clarity in visual storytelling. These principles were essential in ensuring that the data I present—whether 
                                  about game releases or the decline of stealth games—remains accessible and engaging for the audience, allowing them to draw their own insights.

                    <h2>Critical Essay on GameDex</H2>

                        <p>During the design of GameDex, a gaming database platform, I encountered challenges that included making numerous decisions, some of which were successfully implemented, and some of which were not. In this essay, I critically analyze the aesthetic choices made for the site, the challenges I faced and the overall techniques used to enhance the user experience and functionality. I will also be discussing how the elements align with the contemporary design principles in the world of interactive media design.</p>

                        <h3>Aesthetics Functionality and the global design implications </h3>

                            <p>
                                The homepage acts as the introductory point and central hub, guiding users through the entire website. Instead of overwhelming the user right from the start, I looked to create an inviting aesthetic that showcased the site’s colors, elements, and thematic unity without visual noise. '
                                This decision was influenced by Knaflic’s (2015) principles of clutter reduction, emphasizing the importance of removing non-essential elements to streamline cognitive load and improve user focus. Drawing from her insights on the “data-ink ratio,” I prioritized visual simplicity to
                                 ensure that the interface elements communicated straightforwardly without excessive embellishments (Knaflic, 2015). RAWG.io and IGBD, my main initial influences for the website, employed more direct approaches by offering the user as much data as possible from the start. For actual navigation, I kept it to a minimum again. Only the navbar is used to go from page to page, unless there is a button that takes the user to a page based on contextual factors. Getting back to the colors,
                                 I chose a darker color palette. I initially wanted to go for a more colorful “RGB” design, wanting to go full-in with the gamer theme. I decided against it for a less visually loud color scheme. The colors chosen(white, grey and green mainly, alongside black), are contrasty. This decision worked well, in also keeping the content throughout the site easy to read. This also sets up the idea of using conventions to keep the reader engaged. Finally, I have used media, but mostly only just images and data visuals in the theory and art sections of the site. This balance ensures that the site guarantees that content is presented without clutter, supporting both quick browsing and detailed analysis.
                            </p>

                            <p>From the start, my ultimate goal when making the website was to create a highly functional and intuitive, satisfying to-use website. I wanted a lot of the input and output to be very clear for the user. Drawing from Mailloux (1983) on conventions and Knaflic(2015) on design clarity, I wanted to align the project with the evolving web standards to create accessible and intuitive interfaces. Mailloux’s ideas around the designs being context-specific conventions, highlight how design and UI conventions have shifted to prioritize user-focused interface, which I stuck to by having the site adapt through responsive designs and straightforward navigation elements. I also wanted to make sure to keep things simple, without of course hurting functionality. This aligns with Knaflics idea of reducing the cognitive load the user has as they’re interacting and using the site. </p>



                        <h3>Impact of UI on User Experience</h3>
                            <p>
                                Interactivity should play a pivotal role in enhancing the UX on any website or interactive platform. On my site, I wanted to allow the users to explore, filter, and interpret data in ways that make the content more engaging and meaningful to them. This idea allows the user to create their own narrative and story with the content in front of them serving as their canvas. The key interactive elements I used in enhancing UX were:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Filtering Capabilities:</b> The site provides filtering features, enabling users to narrow their search results and focus on particular games. This enables users to personalize their experience and focus on what mainly interests them within the story we’re trying to tell, aligning with Gibson’s (2004) ideas of non-invasive designs. The promotion of an engaging experience without complex navigation steps is made.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Bubble Chart Visualization:</b> Another significant interactive element and visual on the site is the bubble chart, which I added as the final visualization. It visualizes the popularity of games in terms of genre vs. their game ratings. It allows users to hover over bubbles representing games for more details like their title, release date, and rating. This relates to Knaflic’s (2015) guidance on using preattentive attributes, such as color and size, to naturally draw the user’s eye to significant data. I amplified this further by also encompassing the usage of tooltips and hover states. Initially, I didn’t want to use these, thinking they add too much for the user to focus on, but after a redesign, I stuck with the hover effect. The redesign reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. My first design for tooltips was one that had a bigger change on the actual visual.
                                </li>
                            </ul>


                        <h3>Challenges Faced During Development and Solutions</h3>
                            <p>
                                In terms of challenges during my experience of developing the site, I actually did not encounter too many actual technical challenges that halted the entire development fortunately. I think I was able to achieve my main goals, and the simplicity of the overall site definitely helped in that. The only real technical challenge came in actually exploiting the RAWG API. The API, and its data are extremely huge overall in the data set. It has a very extensive documentation however, which definitely helped in learning how to use the data to the best of its ability. The other complicated aspect came when trying to make the visuals. While making the actual table, bubble chart and line graphs weren’t difficult, the only real challenge or decision choice was in choosing aesthetics. These visuals weren’t difficult to make however. Developing interactive features, such as sorting, filtering, and tooltips in the data table and charts, required additional logic to ensure each feature was enhanced rather than hindered the user experience. These were things like error checking, syntax capturing, and so on. For the sorting functionality, custom JavaScript code was implemented to allow for ascending and descending order toggling with just one click on the table headers. Filtering was similarly streamlined to match user queries across different game attributes (e.g., platform, genre). These solutions helped in making data exploration intuitive and responsive, without overwhelming users. The other challenge, something that I could say I somewhat underlooked until writing this essay, came in establishing a clear narrative and information hierarchy for the site. I touched on this earlier, when speaking about finding color schemes and fonts for the website.

                        <h3>Alignment with Professional Practices in International Web/App Development</h3>

                        <p>

                        <p>In relation to alignment with professional practices, the first was in engaging the user with the use of interactivity and data. Dimara and Perin’s(2020) exploration of interaction in visualization is relevant here, because they highlight the importance of flexibility and data-related intent. Their argument is that modern visualization should aim for absolute freedom, enabling users to shape their own experience by restructuring and customizing the systems in front of them. In GameDex, I aligned this by adding drill down features in the filtering that allowed users to filter a year based graph even down to months. I wanted to push beyond the static data presentation as development went on. The impact on the user is to try and convey a perspective rather than a purely analytical display of the data. This aligns both with artistic and analytical visuals in more professional settings. I also aligned the site with more accessible design, with the usage of ARIA labels. The labels play a role in making the interactive elements understandable to screen readers and assistive tech. Alongside this, while I did limit the variety in navigation and interactive elements, making them adapt to the user was the better approach to avoid clutter and keeping everything seamless. Embedding accessibility features, the site adapts to the varied contexts the user gets into. This exemplifies Mailloux’s concept of “context-specific conventions”, demonstrating an awareness of diverse needs from users. </p>

                        <p>With a majority of internet users accessing the internet through their phones, a sort of mobile-first approach had to be taken. While a majority of the site was definitely made desktop, with the usage of responsive coding and media queries, I also wanted to keep a level of scalability in mind. For example, the nav bar maintains its shape but is well usable when we go down to smaller screen sizes, still maintaining the functionality. I could have taken this even further, by making a hamburger menu that hides the nav bar for the smaller display, but decided against it. Making it responsive instead worked well. The interactions are also present in the buttons I used across the site. The sizing both on the desktop and smaller view makes them easy to tap and interact with. I think I could have gone a bit further again with this by creating hover effects that are not reliant on the cursor but on scrolling for the mobile user.  Keeping mobile and other display sizes in mind, stays consistent with Knaflic’s emphasis on simplicity(2015). Integrating these responsive features also just expands our goal of creating a functional and satisfying user experience. </p>

                        <P>The key areas where the site could be improved to align further with professional practices, is firstly in testing and performance optimization. The first issue is load times within the visuals. While the site includes visuals that enhance UX, I did not implement any features that look to prevent this, apart from just messages and text to indicate to the user data is still being loaded. As noted, slow load times can hinder user engagement. Funny enough, this was something I definitely experienced during testing but never tried to find a fix for it. To improve on this in the future, I could expand the usage of CSS and JavaScript files by separating the modules and functions further. Furthermore, server-side caching of API response and, implementing lazy loading could reduce real-time data requests also enhancing the efficiency. In terms of testing, using platforms like LambdaTest to test the site across multiple configurations is something I can use in future. The other area with room for improvement was in the actual coding practice. I sabotaged myself somewhat by using a smaller amount of JavaScript and CSS files, which did make navigation around the pages when trying to fix certain areas of code a bit of a challenge. </P>
                        </p>

                        <p>While the project met many of my goals, such as interactive features, responsive design, there were areas that could benefit from further refinement. Extensive testing and performance optimizations would push our goals even further. In conclusion, GameDex serves as both a reflection of modern web development practices and an opportunity for growth as a designer.
